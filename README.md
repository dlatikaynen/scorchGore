What critics have to say:  
"*A master class in color use, layout, composition, and everything*"  
"*Truly a masterpiece - brilliantly engineered, form follows function*"  
"*Whoever said Times New Roman was dead - this game proves them wrong*"  
"*No game loop, no framerate, the pinnacle of late eighties arcade*"
