how do players find each other?

The principle is unguessable guid files, which contain information
that exists only on local PCs of each, and they tell each other by
exchanging a join token.

To simulate locally, the ordinal of scorchgore.exe processes
(the how manieth instance am I) is made a part of the device-binding
hash.

The initiating player invents a hash, stores it as a file name,
which at the same time contains the name and the game, and pushes it to the server.
and tells it to the joining player by means of any communication medium.

Players cannot join their own invitation simply by checking if the file is
already on their local storage when they enter the token into the "Join" box.

Only the invited player is able to find that file since she will have the hash.
When she finds it she notes it down in their local settings directory.

The initiating player polls the remote file (handshake file) until
their peer have written their reciprocal one-off token into it.

The way how this is done is that every players turn works as follows:
they know the watermark, poll for one higher, and when it appears read it,
add its content to the collective game description file, delete it, and then
place their own next move.

This protocol is the most ingenious online gaming protocol ever invented,
and this is best illustrated by the following sequence (files and content):


Games are resumed by delayless replay of a whole-ass level history file.

-1----------------------------------------------------------------------
invitingplayertoken.ligma
HELO dlatikay
------------------------------------------------------------------------

1 knows to wait for .1 since they are aware that they just initiated.

-2----------------------------------------------------------------------
invitingplayertoken.ligma
HELO dlatikay
invitingplayertoken.1.ligma
OHAI pommesfritz
------------------------------------------------------------------------

now the inviter knows that the invitee has joined since the file with
the next expected number has appeared. it is always a ping-pong, with the
one player always writing even numbers and the other one always writing
odd numbers!
The polling-and-receiving player then reads the content, interprets it,
adds it to the main ligma, and places their next file, as follows:

-3-----------------------------------------------------------------------
invitingplayertoken.ligma
HELO dlatikay
OHAI pommesfritz
invitingplayertoken.2.ligma
ENTER WORLD 1 LEVEL 1 WITH SCISSORS dlatikay
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

so they can play now. the starting player is determined by SSP.

-4-----------------------------------------------------------------------
invitingplayertoken.ligma
HELO dlatikay
OHAI pommesfritz
ENTER WORLD 1 LEVEL 1 WITH SCISSORS dlatikay
invitingplayertoken.3.ligma
I HAD STONE pommesfritz
c60 60 FIRE pommesfritz
-------------------------------------------------------------------------



Sequence example:
================

When A initiates and wins the SSP

B peer-odd                 | A initiator-even
--------------------------------------------------------
                           | SATTELT DIE HÜHNER
                           | HELO A
1 OHAI B                   |
  I HAVE SCISSORS          |
                           | 2 I HAD SCISSORS FIRST
                           |   CANVAS_THE_TOWN_BRUSH_THE_BACKDROP
                           |   c60 60 FIRE IN THE HOLE
3 c75 72 FIRE IN THE HOLE  |


WHen B initiates and loses the SSP to A

B initiator-even           | A peer-odd
--------------------------------------------------------
SATTELT DIE HÜHNER         |
HELO B                     |
                           | 1 OHAI A
                           |   I HAVE PAPER
2 I HAD STONE              |
  CANVAS_THE_TOWN_BRUSH_TH |
                           | 3 78 78 FIRE IN THE HOLE
